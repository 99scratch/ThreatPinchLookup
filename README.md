# ThreatPinch Lookup

## Introduction

ThreatPinch Lookup creates informational tooltips when hovering oven an item of interest on any website. It helps speed up security investigations by automatically providing relevant information upon hovering over any IPv4 address, MD5 hash, SHA2 hash, and CVE title. Itâ€™s designed to be completely customizable and work with any rest API.

## Chrome Web Store

You can download the ThreatPinch Lookup extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threatpinch-lookup/ljdgplocfnmnofbhpkjclbefmjoikgke).

[ThreatPinch Lite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threatpinch-lite/jcjcflihdgdhapkadakfahkplbafobbi) is also available which has all the API lookups of ThreatPinch, but without the on hover injection code. ThreatPinch Lite relies on only the highlight right click search, and requires only permissions to make request to APIs which do not allow CORS requests.

## How can I contribute/help ThreatPinch Lookup?

The best way to help or contribute to this project is to share any custom integrations you create with the community! Otherwise positive reviews and feedback in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threatpinch-lookup/ljdgplocfnmnofbhpkjclbefmjoikgke) and [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/threatpinch-lookup) would be greatly appreciated!

## Where is my data stored?

There is no backend server or database for ThreatPinch Lookup. All data is stored in locally used PouchDB databases. It all exists in your browser. Previously Chrome remote storage was used for some configuration items, this proved too challenging due to limitations on the storage. Going forward the Pouch databases will allow for some more interesting functionality.

Optionally, in the developers options you can configure a CouchDB server to sync your API responses with. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/cloudtracer/ThreatPinchLookup/wiki) for more details.

## Firefox build?
If you are desperate for the Firefox build of ThreatPinch Lookup I've made it temporarily available [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cloudtracer/ThreatPinchLookup/8b3b9602/Firefox-install.html), just click install then ignore all the security warnings like a good security pro.

## Release Notes
- 3.0.0: 2018-03-25 - New graph, ability to pivot and perform lookup of related graph items. CSV Exports for bulk lookups page. New virtual components on bulk search page. All requests and response processing performed through web workers for better performance. Added Recorded Future Lookups by @cicakdinding01. Added Google Safe Browser, Have I Been Pwned Lookups. Ability to toggle lookups to work either via on hover or via search page (more intrusive popovers could be left to working only on search page).
- 2.0.24: 2018-02-18 - Added PulseDive lookups.
- 2.0.23: 2018-02-08 - Catch Jexl errors (no impact, just noise in the console).
- 2.0.22: 2018-02-08 - Fix issue where custom width settings would not persist across upgrades, added AV vendor names back to VirusTotal lookups. Expose JSON Path parent objects name with ${PINCH.LOOPPARENTS} and ${PINCH.LOOPPARENTNAME}
- 2.0.18: 2018-01-31 - Pushed 2.0.17 updates to Chrome extension. Added Zoomeye, Bitcoin WhosWho and enhanced Shodan/Censys popup data. Upgraded PouchDB to latest for performance improvements.
- 2.0.17: 2017-11-09 - Remove Firefox store links, Mozilla reviewers deactived plugin after constant re-reviews. Will make Firefox builds available elsewhere, do not have time to deal with constant re-reviews for silly issues.

Icons should be easier to use in the future. Loop conditions were removed, if you need them use JSON Path arguments to filter content. Reliance on unsafe-eval was removed. These changes will be migrated to the Chrome Extension after some additional testing. Firefox versions should be fully functional at this point, if not please report any issues.
- 2.0.14: 2017-09-18 - Full ThreatPinch Lookup XPI file for Firefox available in this repo, still some minor bugs related to the drag and drop. Working on cleaning up some items to get it through the Mozilla Add-ons review process.

All configuration settings are now soley hosted in a locally stored PouchDB (using chrome storage became a big pain). Added Shodan API group settings. Implemented 24 hour request caching for successful lookups which means if you look up the same observable in less than 24 hours it won't cost you any extra API requests (next version this will be user configurable and trackable).
